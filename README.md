# Huffman Coding

This project implements Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm, in the C/C++ programming language.

Huffman Coding efficiently compresses data by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequently occurring characters. This results in reduced storage space for the encoded data while preserving its original content.


## Technologies and Concepts Used

**C**  
**C++**  
**Graphs**  
**Min Heap**  
**Huffman Tree**


## Features

- **Encoding:** Converts a given text file into a compressed binary file using Huffman Coding.
- **Decoding:** Decompresses a Huffman-encoded binary file back into its original text format.
- **Min Heap Data Structure:** Optimizes the construction of the Huffman tree, a crucial step in the encoding and decoding processes.



## Advanced Data Structures Used

#### **Graphs**
Graphs can be used to represent the relationship between multiple entities. We can convert the data into graph nodes and run the necessary queries to find the answers.

#### **Min Heap**
Implemented as a binary heap, it ensures that the characters with the lowest frequencies are always at the root.

#### **Huffman Tree**

It is a binary tree used in Huffman coding, where characters with higher frequencies are closer to the root, enabling efficient encoding and decoding of data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters. It dynamically organizes characters based on their frequencies, ensuring optimal compression while preserving the original data.
